In this project, we mainly investigate three variable selection approaches (LASSO, SCAD, and MCP) to identify key behaviors relevant to learning outcomes (certificated or not).
In detail, cross-validation is employed to tune hyperparameters in the algorithm, and prediction results in the test set is used to measure the effectiveness of these three selection approaches.
